## Get to Know Me!

Hello! I'm Anna Tackabery, a fourth-year UCSB student pursuing a B.S. in Environmental Studies with a concentration in Geography. I will be graduating in June 2024. I'm passionate about sustainability and combating climate change for a better future. I want to go into Environmental Consulting to help mitigate waste and promote sustainability. During my time at UCSB, I have enjoyed the beach, hiking, spending time with my friends, and getting involved in my community.
