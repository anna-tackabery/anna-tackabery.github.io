    "text": "Here are a few courses I’ve completed that I feel most impacted my learning at UCSB.\n\n\nGreen building is a course offered that covers the major topics of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and LEED Certification processes. In this course we completed a Case Study of a building on campus to see how we could improve the building’s energy and water usage, and occupant comfort.\nThe LEEDLab is a year-long course that is offered concurrently with the green building class. The green building class really helped me to get a foundation in LEED, but the LEEDLab helped me to get real world experience. The goal in the LEEDLab this year was to re-certify Bren Hall with the LEED v4 for Building Operations and Maintenance - Existing Building Rating System. Bren Hall has been certified three times before! Once when it was built and its been re-certified twice (every 5 years) all awarding it with the LEED Platinum Certification. LEED Platinum Certification is the highest Certification offered!\nThis course has been very gratifying because I’ve been able to see how my part in this project will hopefully help the building to get certified. We are currently waiting to hear back if the certification will be awarded. The class was divided up into groups based on the credit categories and I worked in the Energy and Atmosphere group. I specifically worked on the Demand Response Credit, the Fundamental Refrigerant Credit, and the Enhanced Refrigerant Credit. We had to prove that we were enlisted in a demand response program through the local energy utility, and that the building didn’t use any CFC refrigerants. We were unsuccessful in attaining the Enhanced Refrigerant Credit because the building uses refrigerants and the impact was over the threshold that was required for this credit.\n\n\nAfter taking the green building course, you are almost ready to take the Green Building Certification Inc. LEED Green Associate exam. I studied for a few extra weeks, and took the exam in May 2024. I’m very excited to announce that I PASSED the exam and am not a LEED accredited professional. This certification shows that I have basic fundamental knowledge of LEED and could help work on project teams to work on building certificatons.\n\n\n\n\nStats for Environmental Science was a very impactful class for me. This class covers statistical tests, analysis, and coding with R. My understanding of statistical tests is much more thorough then before this class, and I would feel confident running statistical analysis on a dataset in the field. I also feel that this class has furthered my skills in R and science communication through R. My final project in this class was making this website!\n\n\n\nExploring Water Data was a course that really helped me get very basic understandings of how to use R. This class was primarily about coding in R and using R to clean data sets. I really enjoyed this class because I felt like it gave me real world skills that I could apply to a job in the future. For our Final Project we were tasked with finding our own public data set, converting it into a visualization, and having a spacial component. I think this project was one of my most challenging yet gratifying experiences in my college courses because real world data sets are not perfect or even very nice to work with! There was a lot of renaming, pivoting, and cleaning of the data sets to get them ready to work with.\n  \nProject HTML\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Systems was a class at UCSB that opened my eyes to the possibilities of energy. I learned all about the benefits and consequences of each type of renewable energy. In this class, I learned in depth about how each system works and the physics behind it. I think this was really important because now I can make cost benefit analysis and possibly work on improving these mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffshore Wind Energy\n\n\n\nClimate Change Mitigation was a very inspiring class for me. It was the first time I had taken a class that discussed new and realistic pathways to combat climate change. I learned all about climate modeling and how much it has evolved in recent years, I read reports from the IPCC, and I did a research paper on Direct Air Capture. This class taught me so much about the new technologies that are here to help mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nCould Direct Air Capture (DAC) and storage be the answer to solving climate change?"

    "text": "UCSB Zero Waste Committee \nI worked as the Public Outreach Coordinator for the Associated Students Zero Waste Committee, during the 2023-2024 school year. Throughout this year, my responsibilities were to coordinate with other UCSB and Isla Vista community organizations, to create infographics for ZWC events, and to increase public engagement with the ZWC instagram. Through this internship, I have strengthed my skills in canva and social media marketing.\nInstagram: @ucsbzerowaste\n\n\nUCSB RIVRLAB \nI began volunteering at the Riparian InVasion Research Laboratory during the Summer of 2023. I really enjoyed learning about biocontrol and being a part of the team there. In December, I was brought on in a paid position at the lab. Since then I have spent around 2 hours in the lab every week.\nThe current project we are working on is the biocontrol of Cape Ivy which is a plant that origniates in South Africa. It does really well in coastal and riparian ecosystems in Calfornia and has had a detrimental effect on native plants. In South Africa, where the plant comes from, there is a natural ecosystem feedback loop which manages the invasive plant there. The goal of our work at the RIVRLab is to reintroduce the plant-species interactions which help to limit the overgrowth of Cape Ivy. There is a fly called Parafreutreta regalis which lays its eggs in the Capy Ivy vine and help to degrade the plant.\nThis is a presentation I made in hopes of recieving a UCSB A.S. Coastal Fund Grant which explains this research in more depth.\nCheck out this website to see what other projects done at the UCSB RIVRLAB.\n\n\nUCSB Peer Mentor \nAs a peer mentor for the UCSB CEES Mentor Project 2024 and UCSB Transfer Peer Network 2023-24 I aim to help guide fellow students. This has been a very fulfilling position over the last six months where I have mentored four students. The program is still very new, but I think it’s a great idea to further connect the UCSB community."
